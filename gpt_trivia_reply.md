Here's a Python list of 20 trivia questions along with their answers in the format of `(String, Bool)` tuples. These questions cover basic internet communication principles including the 5-layer model, TCP/UDP, HTTP, delays, caches, and more.

```python
trivia_questions = [
    ("Is HTTP a stateless protocol?", True),
    ("Does the TCP protocol guarantee delivery of packets in order?", True),
    ("Is UDP faster than TCP because it requires a three-way handshake for connection establishment?", False),
    ("Are the Presentation and Session layers part of the TCP/IP model?", False),
    ("Is packet switching a fundamental concept in the Network layer?", True),
    ("Does the Application layer provide end-to-end data communication?", True),
    ("Is the main purpose of the Transport layer to provide reliable data transfer services to the upper layers?", True),
    ("Does the Physical layer define the hardware equipment, cabling, wiring, frequencies, and signals used in the network?", True),
    ("Is ICMP used for error reporting and query messages within the Internet Protocol Suite?", True),
    ("Are HTTP cookies used to maintain state in the stateless HTTP protocol?", True),
    ("Does the Data Link layer establish, maintain, and terminate a connection?", False),
    ("Is the Network layer responsible for data routing, packet switching, and control of network congestion?", True),
    ("Can caches reduce network latency by storing frequently accessed resources closer to the user?", True),
    ("Is the five-layer internet model composed of the Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, and Application layers?", True),
    ("Does HTTPS encrypt the entire HTTP message?", True),
    ("Is SMTP a protocol used for receiving email messages?", False),
    ("Are IP addresses defined at the Transport layer of the OSI model?", False),
    ("Does FTP use TCP for reliable data transfer?", True),
    ("Is the primary purpose of ARP to translate URLs into IP addresses?", False),
    ("Can network delays be caused solely by the time it takes to propagate signals across the physical medium?", False)

This list includes a variety of questions that address key concepts and common misunderstandings related to internet communication principles.
